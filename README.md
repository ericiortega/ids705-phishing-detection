# ids705-phishing-detection

**Final project for Duke's IDS 705 Machine Learning course.**  
This project explores phishing email detection using traditional machine learning and deep learning models. We use the **TREC 2007 Public Spam Corpus** to compare a range of models for their accuracy, robustness, and practicality in real-world email security systems.
